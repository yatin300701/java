# Objects, Classes, Interfaces, Packages, and Inheritance

## Object

An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.
Objects share two characteristics: they all have state and behavior

Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as **data encapsulation**

## Class

A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

## Interface

In interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.

Use the implements keyword

Interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide

## JDK

Java Development Kit

Tools and lib used in Java - Debugger and compiler

## JRE

Java Runtime Environment

text.java -> (compile by javac) -> bytecode (Platform independent) -> (Interpretation by JVM) -> Machine Code

JIT -> Just Intime Compiler -> Hot code / Frequently used code is not interpreted again again , so we store it as compiled code

## Types of Variables
